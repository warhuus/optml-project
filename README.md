# optml-project
This is a mini-project which focuses on practical implementation. It investigates an optimization algorithm
for a real-life machine learning application and gives us insight into that algorithm. We should provide empirical
evidence for the behavior of our chosen optimization algorithm or modification.

**It seems like we have chosen to work with this topic:** "How well do zero-order optimization methods do for ML applications, compared to standard first-order methods?"

## Outline for the project

### Introduction

Present the theory and general idea for zeroth-order optimization algorithms and first-order algorithms. Describe which algorithms we chose and why. Maybe go deeper into what each algorithm is about.

### Our contribution

We make a benchmark for zero-order optimization algorithms to compare them with first-order methods to see how well they apply in ML.
